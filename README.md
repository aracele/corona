<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Observing the worldwide tendency to ignore some diseases that can become a pandemic. the pandemic that is in fashion requiring some knowledge of its behavior for the prediction and estimation of cases from tables of data collected from the global health agencies. These routines are still very primary, but we can already observe some behavior that we can predict or estimate with models of evolution of the infection (I) of healthy individuals (S) that can kill (D) these or let these (R, E) live.
This is a shortcut to a video that is on the <a href="https://cmpaulo.github.io/corona/"> website corona </a> of this repository, it is an FAQ about the corona virus in Brazil. Portuguese speakers from Brazil.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This program has a database until March 24, 2020 for the number of confirmed cases for several countries. With the programs you can carry out an assessment of the lethality of this CORONA 19, and time/number evolution of infections.

### Prerequisites

The list of things that you need to use the software and how to install them.
* pip
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scipy wget
```

### Installation

ABOUT SIR MODEL
The SIR model is a simple mathematical model of epidemics. An epidemic is when the number of people infected with a disease is increasing in a population. S, I, and R.
This model is also missing some elements, such as the creation of new susceptible people by being born, and the removal of susceptible, infected, and recovered people who die.
